# API
This document outlines the various exports and configuration options for the React Native Auth Workflow package.

## Context Providers

### AuthUIContextProvider
The AuthUIContextProvider allows for application code to pass in middleware actions that result from the Authentication and Registration user interface. Often the actions will be the local storage and API calls satisfying AuthUIActions and RegistrationUIActions. UI configuration properties are also passed in.

#### Usage
```tsx
import { AuthUIContextProvider } from '@pxblue/react-native-auth-workflow';

<AuthUIContextProvider>
    { /* ...contents */ }
</AuthUIContextProvider>
```

#### Available Props
-   **allowDebugMode** (optional): *`boolean`*
    - When true, presents a debug button on the login screen to allow access to deep link-based screens/flows
    - Default: false
-   **authActions**: *`() => AuthUIActions`*
    - Provides application actions for the user's authentication needs.
-   **contactEmail** (optional): *`string`*
    - Contact email address to be shown on the support screen
    - Default: provides a fake email address
-   **contactPhone** (optional): *`string`*
    - Contact phone number to be shown on the support screen
    - Default: provides a fake phone number
-   **htmlEula** (optional): *`boolean`*
    - Set to true if your EULA needs to be rendered as HTML
    - Default: false
-   **passwordRequirements** (optional): *`PasswordRequirement[]`*
    - An array of `PasswordRequirement`s that must be satisfied when creating or changing a password.
    - Default: Passwords must contain a number, uppercase letter, lowercase letter, special character, and be between 8 and 16 characters in length
-   **projectImage** (optional): *`ImageSourcePropType`*
    - Project image shown on splash screen and login screen.
    - Dimensions of the image should be 534w x 152h with a transparent background. Differently sized images may not render properly on all devices.
    - Default: Provides an example project image.
-   **registrationActions**: *`() => RegistrationUIActions`*
    - Provides application actions for the user's registration needs.
-   **showSelfRegistration**: *`boolean`*
    - When true, shows the Create Account button to allow for self registration.
    - Default: true
-   **title** (optional): *`string`*
    - Title of the application


### SecurityContextProvider
SecurityContextProvider provides a single source of state for the state of user authentication. It is not meant to authenticate the user or hold credential information. Its purpose is to control access to authenticated or non-authenticated sections of the application (as well as change password for a currently authenticated user).
> Note: the `SecurityContextProvider` should come before the `AuthUIContextProvider` in your application hierarchy.

#### Usage
```tsx
import { SecurityContextProvider } from '@pxblue/react-native-auth-workflow';

<SecurityContextProvider>
    <AuthUIContextProvider {...props}>
        { /* ...contents */ }
    </AuthUIContextProvider>
</SecurityContextProvider>
```


## Hooks

### useAccountUIActions

const accountUIActions: AuthUIActions = useAccountUIActions();
```

### useAccountUIState

const accountUIState: AccountUIState = useAccountUIState();
```

## AccountUIState

Global state for authentication-related activities and forgotten password retrieval.

### Type Declaration
-   **email**: *`string | null`*
    -   The email of the current user.
-   **forgotPassword**: *`ForgotPasswordState`*
    -   State of a forgot password request (which then sends an email to the user's account).

    -   State of the setPassword request, after a user begins resetting a forgotten password using the deep link token from their email.
-   **userToken**: *`string | null`*
    -   The current user's authentication token.


## AuthUIActions

Authentication Actions to be performed based on the user's UI actions. The application will create appropriate actions (often api calls, local network storage, credential updates, etc.) and update the global security state based on the actionable needs of the user. A MockAuthUIActions implementation is provided in the examples folder for getting started with during development.

### Type Declaration
-   **changePassword**: *`(oldPassword: string, newPassword: string) => Promise<void>)`*
    -   An authenticated user wants to change their password. The application should try to change the user's password. Upon completion, the user will be logged out of the application. Upon cancellation, the user will be taken back to the application's home screen.

    -   **Parameters**:
        -   **oldPassword**: *`string`*
            -   The user's current password as entered into the UI.

            -   The user's new password as entered into the UI.

    -   **Returns**: *`Promise<void>`*
        -   Resolve if successful, otherwise reject with an error message.

-   **forgotPassword**: *`(email: string) => Promise<void>)`*
    -   The user has forgotten their password and wants help. The application generally should call an API which will then send a password reset link to the user's email.

    -   **Parameters**:

At the end of validation, the SecurityContextActions should be called with either: onUserAuthenticated (which will present the application), or onUserNotAuthenticated (which will present the Auth UI).
        > Note: Until this method returns, the applications Splash screen will be presented.

        -   Should always resolve, never throw.

-   **login**: *`(email: string, password: string, rememberMe: boolean) => Promise<void>)`*
    -   The user wants to log into the application. Perform a login with the user's credentials. The application should provide the user's email and password to the authentication server. In the case of valid credentials, the applications code should store the returned data (such as token, user information, etc.). Then the onUserAuthenticated function should be called on the SecurityContextActions object.

    -   **Returns**: *`Promise<void>`*
        -   Resolve if code is credentials are valid, otherwise reject.

-   **setPassword**: *`(code: string, password: string, email?: string) => Promise<void>)`*
    -   A user who has previously used "forgotPassword" now has a valid password reset code and has entered a new password. The application should take the user's password reset code and the newly entered password and then reset the user's password.
        > Note: Upon success, the user will be taken to the Login screen

    -   **Parameters**:
        -   **code**: *`string`*
            -   Password reset code from a link

Once called, the Authentication User Interface will be shown.

    -   **Parameters**:
        -   **clearRememberMe**: (optional) *`boolean`*
            -   If true, clear any "remember me" data upon logout.
